# fhnw-mada-rsa
RSA Implementation for mada assignement by Pascal Hostettler

- Class Teilaufgabe 1 generates a RSA KeyPair and saves it as sk.txt and pk.txt
- Class Teilaufgabe 2 reads in the public key (pk.txt) and a text file. Each character from the text file will be encrypted and the full text is saved as chiffre.txt
- Class Teilaufgabe 3 lets you read in the secret key (sk.txt) and an encrypted message (chiffre.txt). The message will be decrypted and saved as text-d.txt.
